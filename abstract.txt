The vertebrae of sauropod dinosaurs have distinctive and complex pneumatic features including fossae and formamina in the sides of their centra. These vary between individually, serially and even betweeen the left and right sides of a single vertebra. This presents a conundrum as bone is usually the least variable material in the vertebrate body. Blood vessels, however, are much more labile, as can be seen in the varied occurrence of vascular foramina in the vertebrae not only of sauropods, but also of birds, crocodilians and mammals. Vascular variation arises in part from the embryonic state of vertebrae which are vascularised from within the neural canal: the hand-off from these vessels to other which penetrate from outside does not always complete. In birds, pneumatizing diverticula enter the vertebrae alongside blood vessels, in the vascular foramina that they form, before excavating the surrounding bone into large pneumatic foramina. We propose that the same was true in sauropods, and that variation of vascularization directly caused variation of pneumatization. In most vertebrae, a single vascular foramen carries both artery and vein, but occasionally these vessels each for a separate foramen. This explains why in rare cases individual sauropod vertebra have two pneumatic cavities on a single side of a vertebrae: each arises from the vascular foramen formed by either artery or vein.
